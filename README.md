## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

It was difficult to implement the third card following the figma file, which did not provide a color. Instead it used opacity. I was able to do it with an extra div with absolute positioning.

### Continued development

I need to improve my use of grid and semantic HTML markup.

### Useful resources

- [The Article Contents Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) - This helped me decide what markup I should use.
